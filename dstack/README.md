# Run steps on dstack

[dstack](https://dstack.ai/) is an open source project, so you can use it for your own cloud accounts from AWS, GCP, Azure, Vast.ai, LambdaLabs, Datacrunch.io, TensorDock. However, I highly recommend to use [dstack Sky](https://sky.dstack.ai/) which is a cloud version of dstack server. As an organization, dstack provides GPU quotas through contracts with various cloud service providers. Hence, it is very likely you could get desired GPU machine. Plus, you will almost always be able to get spot instances too.

Below instructions assumes that you have dstack Sky account, but the same instructions could be applied if you have configured your own dstack server. If you are interested in to create dstack Sky account [check out this link](https://sky.dstack.ai).

## Install dstack client

```console
$ pip install dstack
```

## Config dstack client

For dstack Sky, the endpoint url should be `https://sky.dstack.ai`.

```console
$ dstack config \
--url <YOUR-DSTACK-SERVER-ENDPOINT> \
--project <YOUR-PROJECT-NAME> \
--token <YOUR-DSTACK-SERVER-TOKEN>
```

## Initialize dstack project

```console
$ dstack init
```

## Run a job

The following command launches a LLM fine-tuning job as specified in the [ft.dstack.yml](ft.dstack.yml). Or you could choose [batch_infer.dstack.yml] for batch inferencing step too.

```console
$ dstack run . -f ft.dstack.yml
```

When you hit the command, it will show you a list of plans that you can choose from. For instance, below shows a spot instance with 2 x A100(80GB) could be provisioned at $2.41615/h price in azure.

If you say `y`, the job will be launched, and all the logs on the machine will be displayed until the job is finished. Or you can always go to the [dstack cloud dashboard](https://sky.dstack.ai/runs) to check the logs out at anytime.
