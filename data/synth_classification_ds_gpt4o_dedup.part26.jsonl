Peer-Reviewed Psychological Studies 2. Self-Help through Meditation, Journaling and Inner Work 3. Scientific Findings on Medication and Mood 4.

It requires a confidence that allows us to feel as though we deserve to be respected, and though it seems many of us are born with it, often it slowly wanes over time. As our childish innocence falls to the side, we try to figure out who to be, how to be, and what to believe.\n\nThe trust we have in ourselves dwindles as we become more insecure and vulnerable to judgments, made both by others and ourselves, which in turn causes us to give our power away. We struggle to understand our value, to find a clear path to acceptability in the world around us. The constant bombardment of \u2018look this way\u2019 and \u2018talk that way\u2019 threatens to undermine creativity and self-expression, while the access we have to each other\u2019s personal lives gives free rein to an overwhelming amount of unsolicited advice. \n\nDespite that, our boundaries are still there, hidden within us, waiting only for the time when we will recognize them. When we bring them into consciousness we start to believe that it\u2019s okay to have them. We all know what lines we want others to respect and value, no matter how adept we are at enforcing them.\n\nWe allow ourselves to get lost in the chaos surrounding us\u2014whether we\u2019ve had a hand in creating it or not\u2014and berate ourselves for not being up to the impossible task of meeting everyone else\u2019s expectations. So often, guilt, at the very thought of telling people no, stops us in our tracks.\n\nSomething as simple as telling our loved ones that we don\u2019t want to be touched talked to, or interrupted seems too bold, too rude. But is it?\n\nWhen we consider the repercussions of allowing others to push and take without relief, we are worse for it. And have less to give, both to ourselves and to our community. There is no joy in a person who has no say in their own life. And without joy there can be very little love to share. We inadvertently give control to whoever is willing to take it, all the while perhaps taking the same from others in the name of trying to help them. \n\nSo, what do we do? How do we get back to a place where we know that it is our right to determine how we exist and what we are willing to accept? \n\nThere is so much information available at this time and so many different lifestyles to choose from. Now, possibly more than ever before, we are able to truly live the life that we design. One that gives us meaning and purpose, where we feel like we are truly living from our hearts and souls.\n\nThrough practices such as meditation and journaling, we are able to dig deep, explore our wants and needs, and uncover the set of boundaries that is perfect for us. Given that we are the ones culpable for the lives we create, it\u2019s about time that we started doing so. \n\nOne of the greatest gifts we can give is to be our authentic selves, living our best lives out loud and without shame. Living from that space, we inspire people in a way we never could if we allowed the world at large to dictate us into becoming people pleasers. And, we all know from experience that the people we admire the most are the ones that are just themselves, and allow others to be the same; the ones who respect themselves and others in deep and heartfelt ways.   \n\nThis can be a scary thing to do, and we must acknowledge that there is often a lot of fear that must be overcome. We may not want to face confrontation and conflict, or to make strained relationships even more tumultuous. We can also get caught in the trap of feeling like we should be able to go with the flow in life and learn from all that is presented to us.\n\nAlthough, being open to synchronicities and spiritual messages doesn\u2019t mean that we have to allow others to treat us in unacceptable and uncomfortable ways\u2014rather, we need to ensure we always remain in the driving seat in the creation of our own reality. Part of living with intention is claiming our power and living in ways that are loving toward the self.  \n\nWe\u2019ve all been guilty of letting others push us around and take too much. We\u2019ve all felt the pain and anger of having our boundaries trampled. It can be hard to understand how people can treat us badly, so disrespectfully, especially if they are or were loved ones. Yet, very few of us can claim to have never stepped on toes or pushed in where we didn\u2019t belong.\n\nIt is human nature to give and take, and we all fail occasionally as we strive to find balance. And that\u2019s okay. It is not only understandable but reasonable to expect that we will not always be successful at maintaining our boundaries, or respecting those of others. \n\nIt\u2019s when unhealthy patterns develop that we must get more serious about starting the sometimes tough, but honest discussions that will allow us to navigate our way out of those habits. As silly as it may feel to schedule conversations, it\u2019s ideal to set aside time so that everyone involved is calm, focused and has intentionally thought over what they might want to share.\n\nGenuine inner reflection will also show us where we may be the ones not respecting boundaries. And it is our responsibility, both to the other party and to ourselves, to do something about it. Encouraging our loved ones, including our children, to take personal responsibility and implement their own boundaries is a vital part of healthy, upward spiral relationships. We can be an example for others by not taking their power (even when it feels like they\u2019re trying to force us to) and by claiming full responsibility for our own lives. \n\nAs our confidence in maintaining our own boundaries grows through awareness and practice, so too will the overflow. Our loved ones won\u2019t be able to help but treat us differently, because we will be different. The entire dynamic of our relationships will change as a result.\n\nAt the end of our lives, as we look back on all that we accomplished, all who we have loved, and all that held meaning in our hearts, there will be very little room for guilt over having put up boundaries for our own wellbeing, but there could be a lot of regret if we don\u2019t. \"\n","role":"user"},{"content":"I would classify this under \"2.

We can also get caught in the trap of feeling like we should be able to go with the flow in life and learn from all that is presented to us.\n\nAlthough, being open to synchronicities and spiritual messages doesn\u2019t mean that we have to allow others to treat us in unacceptable and uncomfortable ways\u2014rather, we need to ensure we always remain in the driving seat in the creation of our own reality. Part of living with intention is claiming our power and living in ways that are loving toward the self.  \n\nWe\u2019ve all been guilty of letting others push us around and take too much. We\u2019ve all felt the pain and anger of having our boundaries trampled. It can be hard to understand how people can treat us badly, so disrespectfully, especially if they are or were loved ones. Yet, very few of us can claim to have never stepped on toes or pushed in where we didn\u2019t belong.\n\nIt is human nature to give and take, and we all fail occasionally as we strive to find balance. And that\u2019s okay. It is not only understandable but reasonable to expect that we will not always be successful at maintaining our boundaries, or respecting those of others. \n\nIt\u2019s when unhealthy patterns develop that we must get more serious about starting the sometimes tough, but honest discussions that will allow us to navigate our way out of those habits. As silly as it may feel to schedule conversations, it\u2019s ideal to set aside time so that everyone involved is calm, focused and has intentionally thought over what they might want to share.\n\nGenuine inner reflection will also show us where we may be the ones not respecting boundaries. And it is our responsibility, both to the other party and to ourselves, to do something about it. Encouraging our loved ones, including our children, to take personal responsibility and implement their own boundaries is a vital part of healthy, upward spiral relationships. We can be an example for others by not taking their power (even when it feels like they\u2019re trying to force us to) and by claiming full responsibility for our own lives. \n\nAs our confidence in maintaining our own boundaries grows through awareness and practice, so too will the overflow. Our loved ones won\u2019t be able to help but treat us differently, because we will be different. The entire dynamic of our relationships will change as a result.\n\nAt the end of our lives, as we look back on all that we accomplished, all who we have loved, and all that held meaning in our hearts, there will be very little room for guilt over having put up boundaries for our own wellbeing, but there could be a lot of regret if we don\u2019t. \"\n"}

Wade last year.\n\nHere is a snapshot of pending and passed legislation seeking to restrict or protect access in 2023, including details on a law that took effect in North Dakota this week broadly banning abortion and the defeat of abortion ban bills in South Carolina and Nebraska.\nRESTRICTIONS\n\nFLORIDA: Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a six-week abortion ban this month, which includes exceptions for rape, incest, human trafficking and the life and health of the mother. It cannot take effect until the state Supreme Court rules on the constitutionality of the 15-week ban that is currently in place.\n\nIDAHO: Idaho Governor Brad Little signed a bill this month that makes it illegal to help a minor cross state lines to get an abortion without the permission of a parent or guardian. Offenders would face two to five years in prison. The Republican-led state is currently enforcing a near-total abortion ban, with exceptions for rape, incest or the life of the mother.\n\nMONTANA:\n\nThe Republican-led legislature has passed a bill seeking to overturn a 1999 state Supreme Court ruling that found that the state constitution protected a right to abortion. That ruling has prevented lawmakers in the conservative state from restricting abortion further than the current 24-week limit. The bill awaits Republican Governor Greg Gianforte's signature.\n\nThe full legislature has also passed a bill that would ban most second trimester abortions by prohibiting a common surgical procedure. If signed by the governor, it would take effect immediately. Planned Parenthood has sued to block the measure.\n\nNEBRASKA: Lawmakers in Nebraska's 50-seat unicameral legislature failed to pass a six-week abortion ban on Thursday, after the chamber did not amass enough votes to end debate on the bill. Much of the debate centered on one member's proposed amendment to allow abortions up to 12 weeks. Abortion is currently legal in the state up to 22 weeks.\n\nNORTH CAROLINA: House Republicans have introduced a bill to ban abortion from conception, except to preserve the life or health of the mother. Abortion is currently legal up to 20 weeks. If it passes the legislature, the bill would likely be vetoed by the Democratic governor and would need Democratic lawmakers' backing to override the veto.\n\nNORTH DAKOTA: North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum on Monday signed a bill that bans abortion with exceptions for cases where the mother's life or health are at serious risk. The law, which took immediate effect, also makes exceptions for rape and incest victims, but only during the first six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nThe measure passed despite the state Supreme Court's decision last month not to revive a previous version of the near-total ban, after finding that the state constitution protects abortion rights in some cases.\n\nSOUTH CAROLINA:\n\nThe Republican-led House of Representatives is considering a six-week abortion ban that the Senate has passed, despite the fact that the state Supreme Court recently struck down a six-week abortion ban in a 3-2 vote.\n\nThe Senate tabled discussion of a near-total abortion ban on Thursday after it had been approved by the House. The chamber voted to delay considering the bill until the next legislative session in January 2024, after a two-day filibuster by the five women senators who felt it was too severe.\n\nTEXAS: While abortion is completely banned with very limited exceptions in Texas, Republican state representatives have introduced legislation that would compel internet providers to block websites that supply abortion pills or provide information on how to obtain an abortion.\n\nUTAH: Republican Governor Spencer Cox in March signed legislation to prohibit the licensing of abortion clinics, which abortion rights advocates say would effectively eliminate access in the state. Abortion is currently banned after 18 weeks in Utah.\n\nWYOMING: The Republican-led state legislature passed a bill in March banning the use or prescription of medication abortion pills, and Republican Governor Mark Gordon signed it into law. It is due to take effect July 1. Abortion is currently legal until viability, about 24 weeks, while a state court is reviewing a challenge to a near-total \"trigger\" ban, which was took effect when Roe v. Wade was overturned.\nPROTECTIONS\n\nCALIFORNIA: A Democratic state senator has introduced a bill to protect doctors who prescribe medication abortion pills to patients in other states.\n\nMICHIGAN: Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed legislation this month repealing a 1931 bill that criminalized abortion.\n\nILLINOIS: Democratic Governor J.B. Pritzker in January signed a law protecting abortion providers and out-of-state patients from legal attacks waged by other states.\n\nMINNESOTA: Democratic Governor Tim Walz in January signed legislation passed by the Minnesota legislature's new Democratic majority that codifies abortion rights in state law, as well as a right to contraception and fertility treatment. The Democratic-led House passed a bill to shield abortion providers and patients from other states' legal attacks, and the Senate is considering it.\n\nOHIO: Abortion rights supporters are trying to collect enough signatures to put a constitutional amendment on the November 2023 ballot that would assert a right to abortion.

Before I get to my occasional sense of persecution and other ambivalent reactions to the latest book, a few disclaimers:\n\n(1) Cathi Hanauer, the book's editor, is an old friend, and I've always considered her kind, hardworking, a talented novelist, a cheerfully solicitous mother, a loving wife (to a lucky guy who wasn't me), and an all-around good egg. It wasn't until I read The Bitch 1 (as Hanauer calls the original collection) that I realized that she was also often pissed off and miserable. She and her fellow travelers had been raised to believe that they could have satisfying careers, loving marriages, and fully integrated and happy lives as spouses, mothers, earners, leaders, and whatever else they wanted to be with the full support of their broad-minded partners and society at large. And then they got jobs and spouses and had children\u2014and got mad.\n\n(2) To point out to someone who's suffering that her unhappiness might be less the fault of society and more the result of something she is thinking or doing, well, that's a politically perilous move. Especially when the sufferer is part of a group that actually has been and often still is victimized, double especially when the pointer-outer belongs to the group that has historically been doing the victimizing. Yes, I'm a middle-aged white man. Unconscious privilege on my part? I think not. However, my girlfriend often begs to differ.\n\n(3) My uneasiness\/wounded feelings\/testimony on behalf of The Patriarchy notwithstanding, I enjoyed both books. The writers are smart, engaging, and\u2014even when I think they're blind to their own idiocy or the problems they're creating for themselves\u2014compelling thinkers and storytellers.\n\nIn Bitch 2, Hanauer's shorthand for the second book, another 25 women (including 9 of the originals) grapple with the life choices they've made and ponder decisions that lie ahead. They wonder if cosmetic surgery is a betrayal of feminist principles or a recognition of professional reality. They explain why they left loveless marriages or put up with sexless ones. They regard a lust-fueled affair, appreciate their homemaker husbands, detail the rationale for declining to cut a Hawaiian vacation short to come home to Mom, who's suffered a stroke.\n\nYou might not be surprised to learn that I wondered why, if the bitch has already had her say, she was back. When I telephoned Hanauer to ask, she told me Bitch 2 was about women owning their choices. Less about blame, more about taking responsibility. \"If the first book is about anger and urgency,\" she said, \"this book is about wisdom, and the calm that comes after the storm. How did you channel all that anger from Bitch 1? How did you get to a better place?\"\n\nShe told me that she herself was less riled up than she used to be, more accepting, if ruefully so. We talked about children and love and the political and the personal and therapy and mutual friends and why I'm not married. Then I told her that while I appreciated the humor and insight in the book, I didn't think the women from Bitch 2 were all that calm. I detected an undercurrent\u2014still\u2014of man-blaming, a sense that 14 years later, heterosexual marriage was still to these writers about as good for them as oleander. That many still viewed men as clueless at best. The happiest women in the book, I observed, seemed to be the one whose husband handled the child-rearing and homemaking, the single woman who wrote that \"you need to be a whole person to invite someone into your life,\" and the lesbian who rediscovered her love for her wife while traveling in Paris.\n\nHanauer said that she too noted the emotional generosity in those three essays, as well as the lingering bad-mouthing of men. Did any instances particularly stick out? she asked me.\n\nActually, they did\u2014and so I read a few aloud to her, including these two gems: \"Men, by and large, demand more care and attention and daily propping up than dogs, and only the very best of them give a dog's worth of love back.\"\n\n\"During my pregnancy, I carried around phantom husbands. You will not be surprised to hear that one was supremely unhelpful.\"\n\n\"Men can't write that way about women, can they?\" I asked Hanauer when I finished. \"We're not allowed to, right?\"\n\nI mean, I got it. There was a lot of vile woman-hating out there, particularly online and anonymously. And yes, I didn't know what it felt like to be a woman, when something as simple as walking to the grocery store felt like dodging a group of two-legged predators. But c'mon, did it help anyone for women to engage in the generalized gender-bashing that they'd seen men indulging in their whole lives?\n\nHanauer laughed. \"That's absolutely true,\" she said. \"Women can say things about men that men can't say about women, especially if the men are married. Why? I don't know if men are nicer, or more polite. Or if women are the underdogs, so we get to say shit. The enlightened men don't trash their wives in public, and if they do, it comes off as horrible, but if women [trash their husbands], it's like, 'You go, girl.' \"\n\nThat wasn't right, I thought.

Most people, even boomer facebook, are dimly aware that they are generally only exposed to ideas they are already primed to align with. But they will still flip out -all caps, mispellings everywhere- when particularly egregious example of idiocy swims up their feed. Never mind that in almost all cases these opinions define the term 'non-representative'. This is what keeps the bubble's integrity robust."}

On their 10th album, Heritage, they aren't. For longtime fans, the shift from progressive death metal to full-on progressive rock won't be a surprise: 2003's Damnation gave a good idea of what \u00c5kerfeldt sounded like doing clean vocals sans death growls, and since 1995's debut, Orchid, he's never been afraid to stretch the templates of all the genres they incorporate. (\u00c5kerfeldt's used his airier croon for ages-- here, more confident in that angle, he removed the heavier stuff and expanded upon the airier bridges.) What might surprise you, though, is the intense completeness of the transition: Heritage's 1970s-inspired prog feels more like the follow-up to fellow countrymen Dungen's 2004 opus Ta Det Lugnt than Opeth's own Watershed.\n\nThe 10-song collection is another collaboration with Porcupine Tree's Steven Wilson, who mixed the record with \u00c5kerfeldt-- it has a warm, analog feel, something that lives up to the colors of the cover painting. The brief opening title track is a plaintive, scene-setting piano piece \u00c5kerfeldt says was inspired by Swedish jazz pianist Jan Johansson and the folk music of his country. Elsewhere, guest spots from Swedish flautist Bj\u00f6rn J:son Lindh and Weather Report percussionist Alex Acu\u00f1a (both on eight-minute loud-quiet-loud standout \"Famine\"), give Heritage a mystical, pastoral feel. If you've heard only the King Crimson-nodding lead track, \"The Devil's Orchard\", you have a good idea what to expect: an exuberant, forward rushing blend of bell-bottomed jazziness and Deep Purple, Camel, and Jethro Tull love made more complex with quick tempo shifts, stop-on-a-dime implosions, and breezy, racing, drifting, and other sorts of atmospheric, psychedelic flourishes.\n\nAnother track, the muscular \"Slither\", is appropriately dedicated to Ronnie James Dio. The 37-year-old \u00c5kerfeldt, who says Heritage is an album he's been \"building up to write for and participate on\" since he was 19, has also mentioned listening to Alice Cooper frequently over the past year. You won't necessarily detect the latter in any obvious way, but you'll feel it in the album's appropriation of the texture and atmosphere of an era. \u00c5kerfeldt and co. do offer a convincing take-- it's a pretty, well-thought out collection-- but for all the ideas and layers, Heritage feels somewhat empty. It's the group's most genre-melding, but it's also the most obvious, largely because much of it sounds like things we've heard before. The lifelessness may also be the result of the singularity of the vision: Heritage lacks the usual shift and pull between heavy and soft that they've managed to weave into their music for the past two decades. It feels a bit listless and emotionally distant. When it comes down to it, \u00c5kerfeldt's death growl is more memorable than his rock singing (and both work best when you get them together). There are dynamics here, but not the kind that create unexpected chills.\n\nThe story behind Travis Smith's colorful cover painting is instructive. We're told \u00c5kerfeldt gave the artist a number of references including Pieter Bruegel's \"The Triumph of Death\", Hieronymus Bosch (in general), and the Beatles' Yellow Submarine. The final picture depicts a tree sprouting the heads of each Opeth member with the noggin of ex-keyboardist and backing vocalist Per Wiberg, who left the band after recording his parts for the new record, toppling into \"a pile of ex-members' skulls.\" Beneath those skulls? The roots of the tree that point to the band's devilish roots in death metal. We're also told the nine stars in the sky represent Opeth's nine past albums, the sun representing Heritage. Then comes the line of people \"want[ing] a piece\" of the band, etc. It's fine to get conceptual, of course, but the forced, overripe symbolism of this image and its fussiness point to a problem with the record: \u00c5kerfeldt remembered to include everything here except space for his songs to breathe.

Since then, the briefcase-size satellite\u2019s miniaturized propulsion system \u2013 the first of its kind ever flown \u2013 proved unable to generate enough thrust to get into lunar orbit, despite months of effort by the operations team. Because the CubeSat cannot complete maneuvers to stay in the Earth-Moon system, NASA has called an end to the mission.\nNASA relies on technology demonstrations to fill specific knowledge gaps and to test new technologies. Used for the first time beyond Earth\u2019s orbit, Lunar Flashlight\u2019s propulsion system and green fuel were such demonstrations.

The miniaturized propulsion system included an additively manufactured fuel feed system that likely developed the debris \u2013 such as metal powder or shavings \u2013 and obstructed fuel flow to the thrusters, limiting their performance. Although the team devised a creative method for using just one thruster to maneuver the spacecraft, Lunar Flashlight needed more consistent thrust to reach its planned orbit.\nThe operations team calculated a new orbit that could be reached using the spacecraft\u2019s small amount of potential remaining thrust. The plan called for putting the CubeSat on a path that would place it in orbit around Earth rather than the Moon, with monthly flybys of the lunar South Pole. While this would have meant fewer flybys, the spacecraft would have flown closer to the surface.\nWith the mission running out of time to arrive at the needed orbit, the operations team tried to dislodge any debris from the fuel lines by increasing the fuel pressure well beyond the propulsion system\u2019s designed capacity. Despite limited success, the required trajectory correction maneuvers couldn\u2019t be completed in time.\n\u201cThe student operations team at Georgia Tech, with assistance from JPL and NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center, rose to the challenge and came up with an incredible array of inventive techniques to utilize what tiny amount of thrust Lunar Flashlight\u2019s propulsion system could deliver,\u201d said John Baker, Lunar Flashlight project manager at JPL. \u201cWe learned a lot and honed new methods and strategies for working with tiny spacecraft.\u201d\nAfter having traveled out past the Moon, Lunar Flashlight is now moving back toward Earth and will fly past our planet with a close approach of about 40,000 miles (65,000 kilometers) on May 17.

It continues to communicate with mission operators, and NASA is weighing options for the future of the spacecraft.\nMore About the Mission\nLunar Flashlight is managed for NASA by JPL, a division of Caltech in Pasadena, California. The CubeSat is operated by Georgia Tech, including graduate and undergraduate students. The Lunar Flashlight science team is led by NASA Goddard and includes team members from the University of California, Los Angeles; Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory; and the University of Colorado.\nThe CubeSat\u2019s propulsion system was developed by NASA Marshall in Huntsville, Alabama, with development and integration support from Georgia Tech.

(See the latest figures here.)\n\nScientists have made rapid progress in understanding the culprit, a new virus in the coronavirus family, which has been named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2. The pneumonia-like disease it causes is called COVID-19.\n\nAs the virus has spread, however, misinformation has, too. We\u2019ve written about many bogus claims about the new coronavirus spread through social media, as well as false and misleading claims made by politicians. See our Coronavirus Coverage page for a guide to our articles.  \n\nHere, we answer some key questions about what is known so far about the outbreak and the virus.\nWhen did the outbreak begin, and what is the cause?\nScientists are still working to determine when the virus first emerged in people, but the earliest known instances of the disease occurred in early December in Wuhan, a city of 11 million in central China. \n\nAfter a string of mysterious pneumonia cases, many of them linked to a seafood market selling wild game and live animals, officials reported the outbreak to the World Health Organization on Dec. 31.\n\nBy Jan. 7, Chinese authorities had isolated a virus, later named SARS-CoV-2, as the cause of the disease, and shared the genome a few days later. This allowed other countries to test for the virus, and for scientists to begin devising treatments and investigating how the outbreak began.\n\nCoronaviruses are a diverse family of large RNA viruses that have characteristic spikes on their surface, making them look like they have a halo, or corona, when viewed under a microscope.\n\nMost coronaviruses that infect humans are relatively benign and cause mild respiratory diseases such as the common cold, said Susan Weiss, a coronavirus researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, in a phone interview. \n\nBut in recent years, new coronaviruses have cropped up that are far more dangerous to humans, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, virus, which led to a global outbreak in 2003, and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, virus, which was identified in 2012.\n\nAccording to the WHO, SARS ultimately infected more than 8,000 people, killing 774. Since 2012, there have been nearly 2,500 MERS cases and 858 deaths.\n\nThe new virus is fairly similar to the SARS virus \u2014 and is in the same betacoronavirus subgroup as both the SARS and MERS viruses \u2014 but is considered a new pathogen.\n\nWhat are the symptoms, and how severe is the disease?\nThe virus causes a pneumonia-like respiratory illness that varies in severity, but can be deadly. Symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. \n\nA report in the Lancet that analyzed the first 41 people admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 infection suggests that clinically, the illness is similar to SARS, although fewer patients appear to have diarrhea or upper respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, a runny nose and sore throat. \n\nSome people also report fatigue, and in some cases people have been found to be infected, but clear of any symptoms. \n\nMany of the symptoms are common to other respiratory diseases. Lab tests based on the virus\u2019 genetic sequence can confirm infection.\n\nIt\u2019s not yet known how frequently people die from COVID-19. The reported fatality rates have fluctuated as the disease has spread, hovering around 2-3% in late January, and around 4% as of March 18. For comparison, SARS killed around 10% of infected people, if not more, while seasonal influenza typically kills 0.1% or less, David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, said in an email.\n\nBut these estimates, which are simple calculations of the number of deaths relative to the number of known cases, may not accurately reflect how dangerous the virus is, since the disease course is still underway for many patients, Fisman said. It\u2019s also likely that far more people have been infected, but have not gone to hospitals or had their illnesses confirmed. For example, if two-thirds of cases are unreported, he said, the case fatality rate may be significantly lower. (For more on the fatality rate, see our March 5 story \u201cTrump and the Coronavirus Death Rate.\u201d)\n\nAccording to a February study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 14% of cases in mainland China were severe and 5% were critical.\n\nReports indicate that while healthy people can fall seriously ill and die, deaths are primarily in older folks and those with preexisting conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory conditions and hypertension.\n\nThe Chinese CDC study, for instance, found a mortality rate of 14.8% in patients 80 and older and 8% for those 70 to 79, while the overall fatality rate then was 2.3% for cases in mainland China.\n\nSimilar statistics from Italy bear out this trend. As of March 15, no one in the country below the age of 30 had died from COVID-19, but a fifth or more of those above age 80 with the disease had. In Italy, about 25% of cases have been severe.\n\nHow is the virus transmitted, and how contagious is it?\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the new coronavirus is transmitted from person to person in close contact, within about 6 feet of one another.\n\nScientists suspect the transmission is similar to how influenza is spread, with the virus travelling through respiratory droplets when infected people cough or sneeze. This is how scientists believe past coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS have spread.\n\nThe incubation period, or how long before someone who is infected shows symptoms, is estimated to be around 4 days, but may range from 2 to 14 days, according to the CDC. There is some evidence that asymptomatic people can transmit the virus to others. A March 16 Science study that modeled how the outbreak unfolded in China also found that people who have few or no symptoms may be responsible for the bulk of the disease spread. The CDC, however, says that people are \u201cthought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic\u201d and that asymptomatic people are \u201cnot thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\u201d\n\nIt also could be possible to contract the disease by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your mouth, nose or even eyes. A study released in mid-March by scientists with the National Institutes of Health, CDC, UCLA and Princeton found the virus could be detected for up to 24 hours on cardboard and much longer on hard surfaces including plastic and stainless steel \u2014 for up to two to three days.\n\nAt a March 18 press conference, coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said that \u201cwe\u2019re still working out how much is it by human-human transmission and how much is it by surface,\u201d adding that the fundamental guidelines are to avoid exposure to \u201cexcess number of persons who could be asymptomatic and infected \u2026 and don\u2019t expose yourself to surfaces that could have had the virus on it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also unclear exactly how infectious the new virus is. Several groups of scientists have attempted to estimate SARS-CoV-2\u2019s basic reproduction number, or R0, which is the average number of other people one person infects, assuming everyone in the population is susceptible.\n\nUsing a variety of methods, multiple teams have arrived at figures that generally range from 1.5 to 4, which suggest the transmissibility is roughly in line with that of SARS, but below that of the measles virus, which has an R0 of around 12 to 18, and is one of the most infectious viruses in the world.\n\n\u201cDespite the diversity of approaches taken there\u2019s remarkable consistency in estimates from highly competent investigators, which seem to fall between 2 and 3,\u201d said Fisman.\n\nAn early estimate from the WHO, for example, suggested that every infected person would spread the virus to 1.4 to 2.5 people, on average, while a team at Imperial College London pegged the R0 at 2.6. A group at the University of Bern in Switzerland calculated an R0 of 1.4 to 3.8, and Harvard researchers Maia Majumder and Kenneth Mandl estimated a figure between 2 and 3.1.\n\nWhile the figures provide some clue as to how contagious the virus is, it\u2019s important to recognize that these values don\u2019t necessarily say anything about how widespread the outbreak will be. \n\nAs Majumder pointed out on Twitter, the R0 reflects potential transmission, not actual transmission \u2014 and that even though seasonal flu has a relatively low R0 of about 1.3, it causes millions of cases per year, whereas SARS had an R0 between 2 and 5, and led to fewer than 10,000 cases.\n\n\u201cPlanning, preparedness, and infection control can effectively bring an outbreak of a novel, moderate-R_0 disease to a close even in the absence of vaccines,\u201d Majumder said in a tweet. \u201cBecause of this, estimates of R_0 for #nCoV2019 should be viewed as a call to action instead of a reason to panic.\u201d\n\nHow can people protect themselves from contracting or spreading the virus?\nThe CDC advises people to wash their hands frequently, with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds, avoid touching their faces with unwashed hands, avoid close contact with sick individuals, and avoid social interactions generally to prevent community spread.\n\nThe CDC website provides advice on what to do if you\u2019re sick and other resources.","role":"user"},{"content":"This text is objective.

Symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. \n\nA report in the Lancet that analyzed the first 41 people admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 infection suggests that clinically, the illness is similar to SARS, although fewer patients appear to have diarrhea or upper respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing, a runny nose and sore throat. \n\nSome people also report fatigue, and in some cases people have been found to be infected, but clear of any symptoms. \n\nMany of the symptoms are common to other respiratory diseases. Lab tests based on the virus\u2019 genetic sequence can confirm infection.\n\nIt\u2019s not yet known how frequently people die from COVID-19. The reported fatality rates have fluctuated as the disease has spread, hovering around 2-3% in late January, and around 4% as of March 18. For comparison, SARS killed around 10% of infected people, if not more, while seasonal influenza typically kills 0.1% or less, David Fisman, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, said in an email.\n\nBut these estimates, which are simple calculations of the number of deaths relative to the number of known cases, may not accurately reflect how dangerous the virus is, since the disease course is still underway for many patients, Fisman said. It\u2019s also likely that far more people have been infected, but have not gone to hospitals or had their illnesses confirmed. For example, if two-thirds of cases are unreported, he said, the case fatality rate may be significantly lower. (For more on the fatality rate, see our March 5 story \u201cTrump and the Coronavirus Death Rate.\u201d)\n\nAccording to a February study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 14% of cases in mainland China were severe and 5% were critical.\n\nReports indicate that while healthy people can fall seriously ill and die, deaths are primarily in older folks and those with preexisting conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory conditions and hypertension.\n\nThe Chinese CDC study, for instance, found a mortality rate of 14.8% in patients 80 and older and 8% for those 70 to 79, while the overall fatality rate then was 2.3% for cases in mainland China.\n\nSimilar statistics from Italy bear out this trend. As of March 15, no one in the country below the age of 30 had died from COVID-19, but a fifth or more of those above age 80 with the disease had. In Italy, about 25% of cases have been severe.\n\nHow is the virus transmitted, and how contagious is it?\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the new coronavirus is transmitted from person to person in close contact, within about 6 feet of one another.\n\nScientists suspect the transmission is similar to how influenza is spread, with the virus travelling through respiratory droplets when infected people cough or sneeze. This is how scientists believe past coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS have spread.\n\nThe incubation period, or how long before someone who is infected shows symptoms, is estimated to be around 4 days, but may range from 2 to 14 days, according to the CDC. There is some evidence that asymptomatic people can transmit the virus to others. A March 16 Science study that modeled how the outbreak unfolded in China also found that people who have few or no symptoms may be responsible for the bulk of the disease spread. The CDC, however, says that people are \u201cthought to be most contagious when they are most symptomatic\u201d and that asymptomatic people are \u201cnot thought to be the main way the virus spreads.\u201d\n\nIt also could be possible to contract the disease by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your mouth, nose or even eyes. A study released in mid-March by scientists with the National Institutes of Health, CDC, UCLA and Princeton found the virus could be detected for up to 24 hours on cardboard and much longer on hard surfaces including plastic and stainless steel \u2014 for up to two to three days.\n\nAt a March 18 press conference, coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said that \u201cwe\u2019re still working out how much is it by human-human transmission and how much is it by surface,\u201d adding that the fundamental guidelines are to avoid exposure to \u201cexcess number of persons who could be asymptomatic and infected \u2026 and don\u2019t expose yourself to surfaces that could have had the virus on it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also unclear exactly how infectious the new virus is. Several groups of scientists have attempted to estimate SARS-CoV-2\u2019s basic reproduction number, or R0, which is the average number of other people one person infects, assuming everyone in the population is susceptible.\n\nUsing a variety of methods, multiple teams have arrived at figures that generally range from 1.5 to 4, which suggest the transmissibility is roughly in line with that of SARS, but below that of the measles virus, which has an R0 of around 12 to 18, and is one of the most infectious viruses in the world.\n\n\u201cDespite the diversity of approaches taken there\u2019s remarkable consistency in estimates from highly competent investigators, which seem to fall between 2 and 3,\u201d said Fisman.\n\nAn early estimate from the WHO, for example, suggested that every infected person would spread the virus to 1.4 to 2.5 people, on average, while a team at Imperial College London pegged the R0 at 2.6. A group at the University of Bern in Switzerland calculated an R0 of 1.4 to 3.8, and Harvard researchers Maia Majumder and Kenneth Mandl estimated a figure between 2 and 3.1.\n\nWhile the figures provide some clue as to how contagious the virus is, it\u2019s important to recognize that these values don\u2019t necessarily say anything about how widespread the outbreak will be. \n\nAs Majumder pointed out on Twitter, the R0 reflects potential transmission, not actual transmission \u2014 and that even though seasonal flu has a relatively low R0 of about 1.3, it causes millions of cases per year, whereas SARS had an R0 between 2 and 5, and led to fewer than 10,000 cases.\n\n\u201cPlanning, preparedness, and infection control can effectively bring an outbreak of a novel, moderate-R_0 disease to a close even in the absence of vaccines,\u201d Majumder said in a tweet. \u201cBecause of this, estimates of R_0 for #nCoV2019 should be viewed as a call to action instead of a reason to panic.\u201d\n\nHow can people protect themselves from contracting or spreading the virus?\nThe CDC advises people to wash their hands frequently, with soap and water for a minimum of 20 seconds, avoid touching their faces with unwashed hands, avoid close contact with sick individuals, and avoid social interactions generally to prevent community spread.\n\nThe CDC website provides advice on what to do if you\u2019re sick and other resources."}

Any person can benefit from learning to program \u2014 whether it\u2019s learning HTML to improve your marketing emails or taking a SQL course to add a dose of analysis to your research role.\n\nEven outside of the tech industry, learning to program is essential to participating in the world around you: it affects the products you buy, the legal policies you vote for, and the data you share online.\n\nSo, let\u2019s dig into what programming is."}

Which people have had a shared interest in shamanism? List them.\n\nShamanism or Samanism is a religious practice that involves a practitioner (shaman or saman) interacting with the spirit world through altered states of consciousness, such as trance.[1][2] The goal of this is usually to direct spirits or spiritual energies into the physical world for the purpose of healing, divination, or to aid human beings in some other way.[1]\n\nBeliefs and practices categorized as \"shamanic\" have attracted the interest of scholars from a variety of disciplines, including anthropologists, archeologists, historians, religious studies scholars, philosophers and psychologists. Hundreds of books and academic papers on the subject have been produced, with a peer-reviewed academic journal being devoted to the study of shamanism.\n\nIn the 20th century, non-Indigenous Westerners involved in countercultural movements, such as hippies and the New Age created modern magicoreligious practices influenced by their ideas of various Indigenous religions, creating what has been termed neoshamanism or the neoshamanic movement.[3] It has affected the development of many neopagan practices, as well as faced a backlash and accusations of cultural appropriation,[4] exploitation and misrepresentation when outside observers have tried to practice the ceremonies of, or represent, centuries-old cultures to which they do not belong.[5]\n\n\nThe earliest known depiction of a Siberian shaman, by the Dutch explorer Nicolaes Witsen, 17th century. Witsen called him a \"priest of the Devil\" and drew clawed feet for the supposed demonic qualities.[6]\nThe Modern English word shamanism derives from the Russian word \u0161am\u00e1n, which itself comes from the word sam\u0101n from a Tungusic language[7] \u2013 possibly from the southwestern dialect of the Evenki spoken by the Sym Evenki peoples,[8] or from the Manchu language.[9] The etymology of the word is sometimes connected to the Tungus root s\u0101-, meaning \"To Know\".[10][11] However, Finnish ethnolinguist Juha Janhunen questions this connection on linguistic grounds: \"The possibility cannot be completely rejected, but neither should it be accepted without reservation since the assumed derivational relationship is phonologically irregular (note especially the vowel quantities).\"[12]\n\nMircea Eliade noted that the Sanskrit word \u015brama\u1e47a, designating a wandering monastic or holy figure, has spread to many Central Asian languages along with Buddhism and could be the ultimate origin of the word shaman.[13]\n\nThe term was adopted by Russians interacting with the Indigenous peoples in Siberia. It is found in the memoirs of the exiled Russian churchman Avvakum.[14] It was brought to Western Europe twenty years later by the Dutch traveler Nicolaes Witsen, who reported his stay and journeys among the Tungusic- and Samoyedic-speaking Indigenous peoples of Siberia in his book Noord en Oost Tataryen (1692).[15] Adam Brand, a merchant from L\u00fcbeck, published in 1698 his account of a Russian embassy to China; a translation of his book, published the same year, introduced the word shaman to English speakers.[16]\n\nAnthropologist and archeologist Silvia Tomaskova argued that by the mid-1600s, many Europeans applied the Arabic term shaitan (meaning \"devil\") to the non-Christian practices and beliefs of Indigenous peoples beyond the Ural Mountains.[17] She suggests that shaman may have entered the various Tungus dialects as a corruption of this term, and then been told to Christian missionaries, explorers, soldiers and colonial administrators with whom the people had increasing contact for centuries.\n\nA female shaman is sometimes called a shamanka, which is not an actual Tungus term but simply shaman plus the Russian suffix -ka (for feminine nouns).[18]\n\nThere is no single agreed-upon definition for the word \"shamanism\" among anthropologists. Thomas Downson suggests three shared elements of shamanism: practitioners consistently alter consciousness, the community regards altering consciousness as an important ritual practice, and the knowledge about the practice is controlled.\n\nThe English historian Ronald Hutton noted that by the dawn of the 21st century, there were four separate definitions of the term which appeared to be in use:\n\nThe first of these uses the term to refer to \"anybody who contacts a spirit world while in an altered state of consciousness\".\nThe second definition limits the term to refer to those who contact a spirit world while in an altered state of consciousness at the behest of others.\nThe third definition attempts to distinguish shamans from other magicoreligious specialists who are believed to contact spirits, such as \"mediums\", \"witch doctors\", \"spiritual healers\" or \"prophets,\" by claiming that shamans undertake some particular technique not used by the others. (Problematically, scholars advocating the third view have failed to agree on what the defining technique should be.)\nThe fourth definition identified by Hutton uses \"shamanism\" to refer to the Indigenous religions of Siberia and neighboring parts of Asia.[20] According to the Golomt Center for Shamanic Studies, a Mongolian organization of shamans, the Evenk word shaman would more accurately be translated as \"priest\".[21]\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, a shaman (\/\u02c8\u0283\u0251\u02d0m\u0259n\/ SHAH-men, \/\u02c8\u0283\u00e6m\u0259n\/ or \/\u02c8\u0283e\u026am\u0259n\/)[22] is someone who is regarded as having access to, and influence in, the world of benevolent and malevolent spirits, who typically enters into a trance state during a ritual, and practices divination and healing.[1][22] The word \"shaman\" probably originates from the Tungusic Evenki language of North Asia. According to Juha Janhunen, \"the word is attested in all of the Tungusic idioms\" such as Negidal, Lamut, Udehe\/Orochi, Nanai, Ilcha, Orok, Manchu and Ulcha, and \"nothing seems to contradict the assumption that the meaning 'shaman' also derives from Proto-Tungusic\" and may have roots that extend back in time at least two millennia.[23] The term was introduced to the west after Russian forces conquered the shamanistic Khanate of Kazan in 1552.\n\nThe term \"shamanism\" was first applied by Western anthropologists as outside observers of the ancient religion of the Turks and Mongols, as well as those of the neighbouring Tungusic- and Samoyedic-speaking peoples. Upon observing more religious traditions around the world, some Western anthropologists began to also use the term in a very broad sense. The term was used to describe unrelated magicoreligious practices found within the ethnic religions of other parts of Asia, Africa, Australasia and even completely unrelated parts of the Americas, as they believed these practices to be similar to one another.[24] While the term has been incorrectly applied by cultural outsiders to many Indigenous spiritual practices, the words \u201cshaman\u201d and \u201cshamanism\u201d do not accurately describe the variety and complexity that is Indigenous spirituality.

Pull out this ros\u00e9 at your next weekend barbecue, and prepare to feel popular. A lesson in balance, this highly aromatic blend from Goose Ridge in Washington State delivers bright berry fruit and refreshing acidity, followed by a creamy finish. \n2. Cooler weather doesn\u2019t have to mean kissing your favorite crisp whites goodbye. Weighty enough to hold its own alongside rich foods and warming enough to deserve a place on your holiday table, this bottle is the perfect cool-weather white. Made from the lesser-known Greek white variety Aidani, expect notes of earthy sage and fennel alongside aromas of flint and struck matches. \n3. Craving red wine on a hot summer day? Say hello to this porch sipper. A 90 percent carbonically macerated red blend, it\u2019s highly chillable, with notes of rooibos tea, bright cherries, and a drizzle of balsamic. The sustainably grown melange includes Nebbiolo, Primitivo, Syrah, Tempranillo, and more. On the palate, sweet fruity notes take a backseat to structured tannins, keeping everything in balance.\n4. A sip of Grecian history, Mylonas Ros\u00e9 offers a unique blend of two native grapes: Malagousia and Mandilaria. The resulting wine boasts slightly earthy flavors, with accents of honeysuckle and Camembert rind. This bottle especially shines alongside food, from green salads to cheese plates. \n5. Think all red blends taste the same? Think again. Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Merlot, and Petit Verdot combine to create distinct, structured notes of juicy strawberries and freshly cracked black pepper in this stellar bottling. Prominent tannins make for a slightly drying palate, but well-integrated fruit and acid keep things ultra-drinkable. Far from homogenized, this unique Napa Valley melange highlights how complex and well balanced red blends can be.\n6. With ripe berries, cream aromas, and vibrant acidity, it\u2019s not hard to see why ros\u00e9s made from Pinot Noir continue to gain traction in the States. From Oregon\u2019s Willamette Valley, home to some of the country\u2019s best Pinot Noirs, Stoller Family Estate\u2019s take on pink wine is juicy and refreshing, with enough complexity to grip the palate and pique your interest. \n7. Equally as fun as it is \u201cserious,\u201d this chillable red is a definite crowd-pleaser. It\u2019s from Burgenland, a region in eastern Austria known for its full-bodied reds. For the Gamay lover looking to expand their horizons, this cool kid-approved bottle offers juicy, jammy vibes via an unexpected grape blend: Zweigelt and St. Laurent. A subtly tannic, slightly peppery red, it offers just enough sweetness to keep you coming back for the next sip. \n8. A supple Dolcetto that drinks like a highly expressive Merlot, this soft and juicy red is bursting with aromas of ripe blackberries, damp soil, and blueberry jam. From Massolino, a winery that\u2019s been producing high-quality releases in Italy\u2019s Piedmont region since 1896, this bottling is well structured and drinks like high-end Bordeaux blend, making its $20 price tag even more of a welcome surprise.\n9. Bernard Baudry\u2019s Chinon Les Granges arrives on the savory end of the red wine spectrum. Wafts of roasted red peppers and a bright hint of capsicum deliver everything we seek in Chinon, and more. The family-owned winery grows grapes across 79 acres in the famous Loire Valley appellation, producing a range of terroir-driven Cabernet Francs and Chenin Blancs. This wine was made to be drunk young and paired with aromatic, meaty meals like spaghetti bolognese or herb-crusted rack of lamb. \n10. Crafted as an homage to Madame Clicquot, who famously stated, \u201cOur black grapes give the finest white wine,\u201d the La Grande Collection is Veuve Clicquot\u2019s celebration of the Pinot Noir grape in all of its elegance. A blend of 90 percent Pinot Noir and 10 percent Chardonnay grapes from eight of Veuve Clicquot\u2019s historic grand crus, this bottle has an aging potential of 15 years. Rich brioche notes emerge on the palate without overpowering subtle tropical candied pineapple aromas. On the palate, fine effervescence and stunning acidity keep things light and mineral-driven. This is a lively and highly age-worthy bubbly that\u2019s sure to make any occasion feel special.\n11. A celebration of an extremely versatile native Greek grape, this bubbly pink wine is as easy on the palate as it is on the eyes. From the tiny town of Amyndeon in the Macedonia region, Kir-Yanni\u2019s sparkling ros\u00e9 is made from 100 percent Xinomavro, resulting in an ultra-vibrant, almost red hue that nears that of Lambrusco. A refreshing sip with notes of strawberries and hints black licorice, this sub-$20 sparkler is fruit-forward with high acidity and a faint perception of sweetness on the palate. Its active bubbles tickle the tongue and keep the wine light, bright, and ripe for fried food pairings.
